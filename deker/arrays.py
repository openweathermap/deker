class Array(BaseArray):
    """``Array`` is an abstract wrapper over final low-level arrays containing data.

    ``Array`` is created by collection. It is a ``lazy`` object that does not interact with its data itself,
    but it possesses all information about the array. Interaction with data is performed by a ``Subset`` object,
    which is produced by ``Array.__getitem__()`` method.

    Properties
    ----------
    - ``as_dict``: serializes main information about array into dictionary, prepared for JSON
    - ``collection``: returns the name of ``Collection`` to which the ``Array`` is bound
    - ``dimensions``: returns a tuple of ``Array's`` dimensions as objects
    - ``dtype``: returns type of the ``Array`` data
    - ``id``: returns ``Array's`` id
    - ``schema``: returns ``Array's`` low-level schema
    - ``shape``: returns ``Array's`` shape as a tuple of dimension sizes
    - ``named_shape``: returns ``Array's`` shape as a tuple of dimension names bound to their sizes

    Attributes
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    According to the schema, arrays may have or may not have primary and/or custom attributes.
    Attributes are stored in low-level array's metadata. Primary attributes are immutable and ordered,
    custom attributes are mutable and unordered.

    - ``primary_attributes``: Primary attributes are used for ``Arrays`` filtering. It is an OrderedDict.
      If collection schema contains attributes schema with some of them defined as `primary`, you obtain
      a possibility to quickly find all ``Arrays`` which can have a certain attribute or meet same
      conditions based on primary attributes values.

      E.g., if we refer to the example above and store the information about arrays' data heights into
      primary attribute, we can create a filter ``{"height": 10}`` and find the ``Array``, which data
      was calculated at height equal to 10 meters.

    - ``custom_attributes``: Custom attributes are used to keep some unique information about the array
      or about its data. E.g. you store some weather data, which is calculated at different heights.
      If it is not important for filtering you can keep the information about certain heights in arrays'
      custom attribute, named "height". In this case you won't be able to search by this attribute,
      but still you'll be able to use this information in your calculations, checking it array by array.
      Anytime you can set this attribute to None for any array as it is not a global setting.
      But you are not able to change dtype of custom attributes. In other words you cannot provide attribute's
      dtype as ``int`` and set there any ``float`` or string or whatever.

    API Methods
    ------------
    - ``read_meta``: reads the array's metadata from storage
    - ``update_custom_attributes``: updates ``Array's`` custom attributes values
    - ``delete``: deletes ``Array`` from the storage with all its data and metadata
    - ``__getitem__``: returns a ``Subset`` instance bound to the ``Array``
    - ``__repr__``: ordinary behaviour
    - ``__str__``: ordinary behaviour
